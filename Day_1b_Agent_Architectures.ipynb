It was unlike any chart he’d ever seen. Strange, swirling symbols pulsed with a faint, ethereal light, illuminating the damp stone of his lighthouse. The light wasn’t harsh, but soft, as if it emanated from within the very ink. He held it closer, his heart thrumming a nervous rhythm against his ribs.

What is his routine like? Is he lonely, content, or yearning for something more? A brief detail about his past or his present state of mind could make his reaction to the map more impactful. For example, does he feel stuck in his solitary existence?\n",
            "*   **Show, don't just tell, the map's effect on Elias:** You've mentioned his \"nervous rhythm,\" which is good. Consider adding a sentence or two that *shows* his wonder or apprehension. Does his hand tremble? Does he feel a prickle of excitement or a chill of fear? Does he instinctively look towards the sea or the sky? This would further immerse the reader in his experience.\n",
            "*   **Hint at the nature of the \"beacon\" on the map:** The idea of a \"single, solitary beacon at its center\" is captivating. You could add a subtle detail that either foreshadows what this beacon might represent or deepens the mystery. For instance, does the light of the map's beacon seem to resonate with the light of his own lighthouse? Or does he feel an inexplicable pull towards that central point?\n",
